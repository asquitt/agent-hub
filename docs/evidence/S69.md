## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest -q tests/operator/test_marketing_site_s69.py tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py tests/gate/test_architecture_guardrails_s53.py
pytest -q
npm run e2e
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `18 passed` targeted marketing/operator/guardrail suite.
  - `205 passed` full `pytest -q` suite.
  - `11 passed` Playwright e2e suite.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- New public route `/` is served and validated by unit + Playwright tests.
- Operator and customer pages maintain existing IDs and functional flows while delivering upgraded visual hierarchy and responsiveness.
- Route policy snapshot guard updated for added root route and remains stable.

## Known Risks
- Page styles are still defined inline per page, so future global theming work will require extracting shared style assets.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next focus:
  1. Add unified shared CSS tokens to reduce style duplication.
  2. Add marketing analytics hooks (CTA click events).
  3. Add copy + layout A/B experimentation support.
