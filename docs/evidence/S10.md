# Evidence: S10

## Segment
- ID: S10
- Deliverable(s): Gate Review
- Date: 2026-02-12

## Code Changes
- Files changed:
  - `src/gate/__init__.py`
  - `src/gate/review.py`
  - `tools/gate/review_gate.py`
  - `tests/gate/test_gate_review.py`
  - `data/gate/pilot_metrics.json`
  - `docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.md`
  - `docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.json`
  - `Makefile`
- Summary:
  - Implemented an explicit gate review engine for S10 with pass/fail evaluation against the AGENTS gate criteria:
    - reliability target met in pilot workloads
    - positive design-partner ROI evidence
    - sustainable unit economics under real multi-agent load
  - Added executable gate review CLI (`tools/gate/review_gate.py`) and deterministic metrics input artifact.
  - Added persisted gate decision report (`docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.json`) and human-readable summary (`docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.md`).
  - Added unit tests covering both GO and NO_GO outcomes.

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest tests/gate -q
make gate
pytest -q
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `pytest tests/gate -q` -> `2 passed`
  - `make gate` -> generated `docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.json` with `decision=GO`
  - Full suite `pytest -q` -> `60 passed`
- Failed:
  - None
- Skipped:
  - None

## Verification Evidence
- API contract validation:
  - Gate report schema is deterministic JSON with decision, checks, thresholds, and metrics snapshot fields.
- Security validation:
  - Gate criteria enforce hard blocking when required pilot evidence is missing or below threshold (`NO_GO` path validated in tests).
- Cost/latency validation:
  - Unit economics gate includes contribution margin and minimum multi-agent load checks.
  - Reliability gate includes minimum success-rate checks tied to pilot workload presence.
- Logs/screenshots:
  - `docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.json` records the evaluated GO decision and supporting values.

## Known Risks
- Current S10 metrics input is file-based and manually curated; automated ingestion from production telemetry pipelines is deferred.
- ROI sample size is minimal at this stage and should expand with more design partners.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: S11
- Required context for next segment:
  - Gate evaluator core: `src/gate/review.py`
  - Gate execution command: `make gate`
  - Gate decision artifacts: `docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.md`, `docs/gate/S10_GATE_REVIEW.json`
  - Regression baseline after S10: `pytest -q` -> `60 passed`

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
