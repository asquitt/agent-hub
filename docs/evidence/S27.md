# Evidence

## Segment
- ID: S27
- Deliverable(s): Design-Partner Pilot B
- Date: 2026-02-12

## Code Changes
- Files changed:
  - `docs/launch/PILOT_B_PLAYBOOK.md`
  - `data/pilots/pilot_b_weekly.json`
  - `data/pilots/pilot_comparison.json`
  - `docs/session-packets/S27.md`
- Summary:
  - Added Pilot B playbook with explicit export + compare commands.
  - Generated Pilot B weekly KPI export artifact (`data/pilots/pilot_b_weekly.json`).
  - Generated Pilot A vs Pilot B comparison report (`data/pilots/pilot_comparison.json`).
  - Verified pilot tooling remains executable and comparison output schema is stable.

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest tests/launch/test_pilot_tools.py -q
python3 tools/pilots/export_pilot_metrics.py --pilot-id pilot-b --output data/pilots/pilot_b_weekly.json
python3 tools/pilots/compare_pilots.py --pilot-a data/pilots/pilot_a_weekly.json --pilot-b data/pilots/pilot_b_weekly.json --output data/pilots/pilot_comparison.json
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `1 passed` in pilot tooling test suite.
  - Pilot B export and pilot comparison artifacts generated successfully.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- API contract validation:
  - Comparison output includes deterministic `deltas` keys:
    - delegation success rate
    - avg relative cost variance
    - avg trust score
    - unresolved incidents
- Security validation:
  - Incident delta field included in comparison report to highlight unresolved incident drift between pilots.
- Cost/latency validation:
  - Pilot comparison output shows no reliability or cost variance regression in this dataset (`all deltas = 0`).
- Screenshots/log excerpts:
  - `pytest tests/launch/test_pilot_tools.py -q` -> `1 passed in 0.15s`
  - Comparison report written to `data/pilots/pilot_comparison.json`

## Known Risks
- Pilot A/B data is currently generated from shared local telemetry and may not represent true cross-vertical heterogeneity.
- KPI parity (all-zero deltas) indicates tooling integrity but does not yet demonstrate differentiated pilot outcomes.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: S28
- Required context for next segment:
  - Use `data/pilots/pilot_a_weekly.json`, `data/pilots/pilot_b_weekly.json`, and `data/pilots/pilot_comparison.json` as S28 gate-review inputs.

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
