# Evidence

## Segment
- ID: S55
- Deliverable(s): Playwright operator/versioning baseline
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Code Changes
- Added Playwright harness:
  - `package.json`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `playwright.config.js`
  - `e2e/playwright/support/agenthub.js`
  - `e2e/playwright/operator.spec.js`
- Added CI automation:
  - `.github/workflows/playwright-e2e.yml`
- Added repository wiring:
  - `Makefile` (`e2e-install`, `e2e-test`)
  - `.gitignore` (`node_modules`, Playwright artifacts, `.tmp`)

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
npm run e2e
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `e2e/playwright/operator.spec.js`:
    - operator dashboard/replay/refresh role boundaries.
    - version compare latest pair and compare flow.
    - bearer token refresh scope flow.
- Aggregate run:
  - `8 passed` across `S55/S56/S57` Playwright suite.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- Deterministic runtime environment configured in Playwright webServer env with isolated DB/JSON paths.
- Dedicated Playwright runtime port (`8011`) avoids local `8000` Docker collisions.
- CI workflow uploads:
  - HTML report artifact (`playwright-report`).
  - Trace/video artifact bundle (`test-results`).

## Known Risks
- No PR-level selective test sharding yet; the suite currently runs serially (`workers=1`) for determinism.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: `S56` commercial flow E2E.
- Required context:
  - Browser and API test harness foundations are in place.
  - Operator/versioning flows are now executable in CI.

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
