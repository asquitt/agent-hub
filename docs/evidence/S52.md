# Evidence

## Segment
- ID: S52
- Deliverable(s): GA launch candidate
- Date: 2026-02-12

## Code Changes
- Files changed:
  - `src/launch/rehearsal.py`
  - `src/launch/__init__.py`
  - `tools/launch/rehearse_ga_candidate.py`
  - `tests/launch/test_ga_rehearsal_s52.py`
  - `docs/launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/launch/GA_REHEARSAL_RUNBOOK_S52.md`
  - `docs/launch/S52_LAUNCH_REHEARSAL.json`
  - `docs/launch/S52_LAUNCH_REHEARSAL.md`
  - `docs/session-packets/S52.md`
- Summary:
  - Added S52 GA launch rehearsal module that composes demo reproducibility, onboarding funnel thresholds, incident drills, rollback simulation, and gate-decision inheritance.
  - Added incident drills for policy approval bypass prevention, owner-boundary enforcement, and attestation integrity mismatch rejection.
  - Added rollback simulation covering create lease, promote lease, rollback install, and rollback idempotency replay.
  - Added launch rehearsal CLI to generate deterministic S52 JSON + markdown artifacts.
  - Added tests for S52 module behavior and CLI artifact generation.

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest tests/launch/test_ga_rehearsal_s52.py tests/launch/test_launch_readiness.py tests/lease/test_lease_api.py -q
pytest tests/launch/test_ga_rehearsal_s52.py -q
python3 tools/launch/rehearse_ga_candidate.py
pytest -q
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `10 passed in 1.04s` (launch + lease targeted bundle)
  - `3 passed in 1.10s` (S52-specific launch rehearsal tests)
  - `170 passed in 9.49s` (full regression)
- Expected non-zero:
  - `python3 tools/launch/rehearse_ga_candidate.py` returned exit code `2` because `gate_review.decision=NO_GO` from S51.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- S52 launch rehearsal artifact generated:
  - `docs/launch/S52_LAUNCH_REHEARSAL.json`
  - `docs/launch/S52_LAUNCH_REHEARSAL.md`
- Rehearsal checks:
  - `demo_reproducibility.passed=true`
  - `onboarding_funnel.passed=true`
  - `incident_drills.passed=true`
  - `rollback_simulation.passed=true`
  - `gate_review.passed=false` (inherited S51 `NO_GO`)
- GA decision traceability:
  - `ga_candidate_ready=false`
  - `blocking_reasons=["Gate review blocking reasons: Reliability target met in pilot workloads"]`

## Known Risks
- GA remains blocked by reliability threshold miss inherited from S51 gate package.
- Launch rehearsal currently depends on availability and freshness of gate review artifacts.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: `S53` (reliability remediation + gate refresh)
- Required context for next segment:
  - S52 confirms launch workflow quality and rollback readiness, but release remains blocked by S51 reliability criterion.
  - Use `docs/launch/S52_LAUNCH_REHEARSAL.json` plus `docs/gate/S51_GATE_REVIEW.json` to drive remediation planning and re-evaluation.

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
