## Segment
- ID: S66
- Deliverable(s): Operator UI startup diagnostics panel and E2E validation
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Code Changes
- Operator UI:
  - `src/ui/operator_dashboard.html`
    - Added startup diagnostics mode selector (`all checks` / `failing only`).
    - Added `Load Startup Diagnostics` action.
    - Added startup diagnostics output panel (`#diagOut`).
    - Added client-side diagnostics fetch/render/status handling.
- E2E:
  - `e2e/playwright/operator.spec.js`
    - Added admin diagnostics panel flow test.
- Operator UI tests:
  - `tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py`
    - Added static page assertion for diagnostics control presence.

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest -q tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py tests/gate/test_architecture_guardrails_s53.py
pytest -q
npm run e2e
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `16 passed` targeted operator/guardrail suite.
  - `203 passed` full `pytest -q` suite.
  - `9 passed` Playwright e2e suite.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- Operator console now provides in-page startup diagnostics loading for admin role.
- Diagnostics mode switching (`all` vs `failing`) is wired to query behavior.
- Playwright confirms diagnostics panel enablement and successful load under admin credentials.

## Known Risks
- Diagnostics are shown as raw JSON; large payload readability may degrade without formatting enhancements.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next focus:
  1. Add severity grouping and visual badges to diagnostics panel.
  2. Add copy/export controls for diagnostics output.
  3. Add lightweight panel pagination/truncation safeguards for large payloads.
