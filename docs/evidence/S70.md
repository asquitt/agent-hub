# Evidence

## Segment
- ID: S70
- Deliverable(s): Marketing/operator/customer UI redesign refinement + visual evidence capture
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Code Changes
- Updated UI surfaces:
  - `src/ui/marketing_home.html`
  - `src/ui/operator_dashboard.html`
  - `src/ui/customer_journey.html`
  - `src/ui/version_compare.html`
- Added visual artifacts:
  - `artifacts/screenshots/marketing-home-v2.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/operator-dashboard-v2.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/customer-journey-v2.png`

## Design Guidance Inputs
- Anthropic: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents
- OpenAI agents guide: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents
- OpenAI API resources index: https://developers.openai.com/resources/

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest -q tests/operator/test_marketing_site_s69.py tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py
npm run e2e
pytest -q
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `15 passed` (targeted operator/marketing pytest suite)
  - `11 passed` (Playwright e2e suite)
  - `205 passed` (full pytest suite)
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- Required test-bound selectors and copy remained intact (marketing heading, CTA labels, operator input labels/buttons, customer heading/button/empty-key defaults).
- Full E2E workflows across commercial flow, operator flow, customer flow, and marketing flow remain green.
- Screenshot outputs generated for direct UI review:
  - `artifacts/screenshots/marketing-home-v2.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/operator-dashboard-v2.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/customer-journey-v2.png`

## Known Risks
- Typography currently relies on hosted web fonts; if external font loading is blocked, visual fidelity falls back to local sans/mono stacks.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment:
  1. Extract shared cross-page style tokens into a reusable stylesheet.
  2. Add mobile screenshot baselines and visual regression checks.
- Required context for next segment:
  - Preserve existing IDs/labels/copy used by Playwright and pytest tests.
