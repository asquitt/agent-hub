## Segment
- ID: S67
- Deliverable(s): Diagnostics severity metadata + operator summary badges
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Code Changes
- Diagnostics core:
  - `src/api/startup_diagnostics.py`
    - Added severity tagging to checks/probes.
    - Added `summary` block with failure counts and severity distribution.
- Operator UI:
  - `src/ui/operator_dashboard.html`
    - Added diagnostics summary pills (`overall`, `checks fail`, `probes fail`).
    - Added rendering logic for summary badge updates.
- Tests:
  - `tests/auth/test_startup_diagnostics_s61.py`
    - Added severity + summary assertions.
- E2E:
  - `e2e/playwright/operator.spec.js`
    - Added diagnostics summary assertion.
- Docs:
  - `README.md`
    - Updated diagnostics section to mention severity/counters.

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest -q tests/auth/test_startup_diagnostics_s61.py tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py tests/cli/test_agenthub_cli.py tests/gate/test_architecture_guardrails_s53.py
pytest -q
npm run e2e
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `24 passed` targeted diagnostics/operator/cli/guardrail suite.
  - `203 passed` full `pytest -q` suite.
  - `9 passed` Playwright e2e suite.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- Diagnostics now include severity-rich rows and summarized counts for rapid triage.
- Operator diagnostics panel now surfaces readiness and failure counts without requiring manual JSON parsing.
- E2E confirms summary panel rendering and end-to-end diagnostics interaction flow.

## Known Risks
- Severity taxonomy is static and may require refinement as more incident patterns are observed.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next focus:
  1. Add diagnostics history snapshot endpoint for operator comparisons over time.
  2. Add copy/export action for diagnostics summaries.
  3. Add severity-aware sorting/filtering in operator panel.

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
