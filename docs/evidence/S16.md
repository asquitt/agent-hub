# Evidence: S16

## Segment
- ID: S16
- Deliverable(s): D18
- Date: 2026-02-12

## Code Changes
- Files changed:
  - `src/launch/__init__.py`
  - `src/launch/readiness.py`
  - `tools/launch/check_launch_readiness.py`
  - `tests/launch/test_launch_readiness.py`
  - `data/launch/onboarding_metrics.json`
  - `docs/launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/launch/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md`
  - `docs/launch/S16_READINESS.json`
  - `Makefile`
- Summary:
  - Implemented D18 launch motion execution artifacts with executable readiness checks.
  - Added reproducible demo smoke flow that validates key product journeys.
  - Added onboarding conversion funnel evaluator with threshold-based pass/fail gating.
  - Added launch readiness CLI to generate `docs/launch/S16_READINESS.json`.
  - Added launch plan and demo runbook docs for GTM and repeatable demo execution.

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
make launch-test
make launch-check
pytest tests/integration -q
pytest -q
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `make launch-test` -> `2 passed`
  - `make launch-check` -> `launch_ready=true`, report written to `docs/launch/S16_READINESS.json`
  - `pytest tests/integration -q` -> `10 passed`
  - Full suite `pytest -q` -> `74 passed`
- Failed:
  - None
- Skipped:
  - None

## Verification Evidence
- API contract validation:
  - Demo smoke checks cover health, registration, retrieval, search, and operator dashboard paths.
  - Launch readiness report captures structured pass/fail outputs for demo and funnel gates.
- Security validation:
  - Demo path reuses API-key protected endpoints and operator role checks.
  - No privileged write paths are bypassed in launch checker flows.
- Cost/latency validation:
  - Onboarding funnel gate includes explicit conversion thresholds to track launch efficiency.
  - Demo reproducibility check validates operational readiness before launch activation.
- Logs/screenshots:
  - Launch readiness output captured in `docs/launch/S16_READINESS.json`; no screenshots required.

## Known Risks
- Funnel metrics are currently static sample inputs; automated production telemetry ingestion remains future work.
- Launch checker validates core API flows but does not yet include external dependency chaos scenarios.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: Post-S16 operational hardening and telemetry automation
- Required context for next segment:
  - Launch readiness logic: `src/launch/readiness.py`
  - Launch checker CLI: `tools/launch/check_launch_readiness.py`
  - Launch docs and runbook: `docs/launch/LAUNCH_PLAN.md`, `docs/launch/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md`
  - Final regression baseline: `pytest -q` -> `74 passed`

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
