## Segment
- ID: S71
- Deliverable(s): Visual redesign pass v3 across marketing + operator + customer + version compare
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Code Changes
- Updated:
  - `src/ui/marketing_home.html`
  - `src/ui/operator_dashboard.html`
  - `src/ui/customer_journey.html`
  - `src/ui/version_compare.html`
- Added screenshot artifacts:
  - `artifacts/screenshots/marketing-home-v3.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/operator-dashboard-v3.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/customer-journey-v3.png`

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest -q tests/operator/test_marketing_site_s69.py tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py
npm run e2e
pytest -q
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `15 passed` targeted pytest suite
  - `11 passed` Playwright e2e suite
  - `205 passed` full pytest suite
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- Required selector/text contracts remained stable:
  - marketing heading/CTA/nav labels
  - operator label/button text and element IDs
  - customer heading, disabled state behavior, and empty default key fields
- Full Playwright flows remained green after structural and style changes.
- Updated screenshots produced for review:
  - `artifacts/screenshots/marketing-home-v3.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/operator-dashboard-v3.png`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/customer-journey-v3.png`

## Known Risks
- UI files still include page-local CSS; no shared token stylesheet yet.
- External font loading can affect fidelity under restricted network conditions.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment:
  1. Extract shared styles into static CSS assets.
  2. Add visual snapshot/regression checks for key routes.
- Required context for next segment:
  - Do not alter IDs/labels tied to Playwright and pytest tests.

## Mandatory Confirmation

- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
