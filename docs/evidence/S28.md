# Evidence

## Segment
- ID: S28
- Deliverable(s): Gate Review v2 + GA Decision
- Date: 2026-02-12

## Code Changes
- Files changed:
  - `tools/gate/review_v2.py`
  - `tests/gate/test_gate_review_v2.py`
  - `docs/gate/S28_GATE_REVIEW.json`
  - `docs/gate/S28_GATE_REVIEW.md`
  - `docs/session-packets/S28.md`
- Summary:
  - Added Gate Review v2 generation script consuming pilot A/B weekly KPI exports.
  - Derived gate metrics and evaluated explicit threshold checks using existing gate engine.
  - Generated final S28 gate artifacts:
    - `docs/gate/S28_GATE_REVIEW.json`
    - `docs/gate/S28_GATE_REVIEW.md`
  - Gate decision result: `NO_GO` due to unit economics / multi-agent load threshold not met.

```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `4 passed` for gate + pilot tooling generation tests.
  - `49 passed` consolidated S18-S28 regression sweep.
  - Gate report generation command completed successfully and emitted artifacts.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- API contract validation:
  - Gate v2 script output includes decision, checks, blocking reasons, thresholds, metrics snapshot, and source artifacts.
- Security validation:
  - Gate decision includes reliability and ROI criteria pass/fail outcomes tied to pilot evidence and explicit thresholds.
- Cost/latency validation:
  - Economics check failed by evidence:
    - `contribution_margin_ratio = 0.0` (< `0.2` threshold)
    - `multi_agent_tasks = 2` (< `100` threshold)
  - Reliability and ROI checks passed.
- Screenshots/log excerpts:
  - `docs/gate/S28_GATE_REVIEW.json` decision: `NO_GO`
  - Blocking reason: `Sustainable unit economics under real multi-agent load`
  - Consolidated regression output: `49 passed in 2.33s`

## Known Risks
- Gate result is constrained by low pilot workload volume and limited marketplace settlement activity in current dataset.
- ROI/contribution proxies are derived from current instrumentation and should be revalidated with production telemetry before GA.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: N/A
- Required context for next segment:
  - Before GA reconsideration, increase multi-agent pilot workload and settle sufficient marketplace transactions to produce valid unit-economics evidence.

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
