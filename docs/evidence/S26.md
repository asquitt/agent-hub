# Evidence

## Segment
- ID: S26
- Deliverable(s): Design-Partner Pilot A
- Date: 2026-02-12

## Code Changes
- Files changed:
  - `tools/pilots/export_pilot_metrics.py`
  - `tools/pilots/compare_pilots.py`
  - `tests/launch/test_pilot_tools.py`
  - `docs/launch/PILOT_A_PLAYBOOK.md`
  - `docs/launch/INCIDENT_TAXONOMY.md`
  - `data/pilots/pilot_a_weekly.json`
  - `docs/session-packets/S26.md`
- Summary:
  - Added pilot instrumentation tooling for weekly KPI exports (`export_pilot_metrics.py`).
  - Added incident taxonomy definition for pilot incident logging consistency.
  - Added Pilot A playbook with executable runbook command path.
  - Generated Pilot A weekly KPI export artifact at `data/pilots/pilot_a_weekly.json`.
  - Added tooling test coverage for pilot export/compare scripts.

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest tests/launch/test_pilot_tools.py tests/launch/test_launch_readiness.py -q
python3 tools/pilots/export_pilot_metrics.py --pilot-id pilot-a --output data/pilots/pilot_a_weekly.json
```

## Test Results
- Passed:
  - `3 passed` in launch/pilot tooling suite.
  - Pilot A export generated successfully with KPI payload.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- API contract validation:
  - Pilot export schema validated by tooling tests (`pilot_id`, `generated_at`, `metrics` payload shape).
- Security validation:
  - Incident taxonomy formalized (`docs/launch/INCIDENT_TAXONOMY.md`) for consistent policy/reliability incident categorization.
- Cost/latency validation:
  - Pilot A weekly export includes:
    - delegation success rate
    - hard-stop count
    - average relative cost variance
    - unresolved incident count
- Screenshots/log excerpts:
  - `pytest ... -q` -> `3 passed in 0.63s`
  - Pilot A export generated with:
    - `delegation_success_rate=1.0`
    - `hard_stop_count=0`
    - `avg_relative_cost_variance=0.15`

## Known Risks
- Current pilot KPI exports derive from local deterministic datasets; real partner telemetry integration remains required for production-grade reporting.
- Pilot instrumentation currently provides snapshot export and not scheduled automated ETL.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: S27
- Required context for next segment:
  - Reuse same tooling for pilot B export and produce comparison report versus `data/pilots/pilot_a_weekly.json`.

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
