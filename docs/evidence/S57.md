## Segment
- ID: S57
- Deliverable(s): Customer journey UI + mobile/Desktop E2E
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Code Changes
- Added customer journey UI:
  - `src/ui/customer_journey.html`
- Added route and access policy wiring:
  - `src/api/app.py` (`GET /customer`)
  - `src/api/access_policy.py` (public route classification for `/customer`)
- Added tests:
  - `e2e/playwright/customer-ui.spec.js`
  - `tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py` (customer page serve check)
  - `tests/gate/test_architecture_guardrails_s53.py` (route policy snapshot update)

## Test Commands Executed
```bash
pytest tests/operator/test_operator_ui.py tests/gate/test_architecture_guardrails_s53.py -q
npm run e2e
```

## Test Results
- `pytest`:
  - `8 passed, 2 warnings`.
- Playwright:
  - customer full demo run passes.
  - mobile viewport usability smoke passes.
  - suite aggregate: `8 passed`.
- Failed: `0`
- Skipped: `0`

## Verification Evidence
- Customer UI full run performs:
  - agent register + version update,
  - capability search,
  - delegation + operator dashboard/replay checks,
  - listing/procurement approval/purchase/settlement,
  - dispute resolution + payout,
  - billing invoice generation + reconciliation,
  - version compare.
- Output artifact includes consolidated run summary IDs (`agent_id`, `delegation_id`, `contract_id`, `invoice_id`).
- Route guardrail snapshot updated for added `/customer` endpoint (`84` route rows).

## Known Risks
- Customer journey page is a deterministic demo console intended for controlled environments and seeded API identities; it is not a production-authenticated UX.

## Next Segment Handoff
- Recommended next segment: `S58` (optional) customer-facing auth/session UX hardening and segmented role views.
- Required context:
  - Unified customer workflow is now browser-executable and covered by automated tests.

## Mandatory Confirmation
- [x] `docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx` updated
- [x] `docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md` updated
