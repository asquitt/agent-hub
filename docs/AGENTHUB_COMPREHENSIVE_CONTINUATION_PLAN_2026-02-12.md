# AgentHub Comprehensive Continuation Plan (Dual-Track)

Updated: 2026-02-12
Owner: Platform
Status: Active continuation plan after S01-S16 completion

## 1) Decision: Build Both, As One System

Yes, we should do both ideas in parallel as two layers of one product:

- Layer 1 (Human-facing DevHub): Registry, versioning, eval evidence, trust/reputation, collaboration.
- Layer 2 (Agent-native Runtime Exchange): Capability discovery, delegation, leasing/installation, policy and budget enforcement, auditable execution.

Why this is the right move now:

- Enterprise adoption is already high, but orchestration is fragmented.
- The biggest pain is not model quality alone; it is interoperability, governance, and cross-agent coordination.
- A layered architecture gives fast adoption (Layer 1) and long-term moat (Layer 2 transaction + trust graph).

## 2) Current Baseline (Where We Resume)

Completed foundation:

- Segments `S01` through `S16` are marked `DONE` in `/Users/demarioasquitt/Desktop/Projects/Entrepreneurial/agent-hub/docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md`.
- Core specs, adapters, trust, eval, delegation, lease, billing, gate review, launch artifacts already exist.

Implication:

- Next work should not rebuild core primitives; it should harden, integrate, and productize them for real design-partner usage.

## 3) Strategic Architecture (Coexistence Model)

### Shared core (single source of truth)

- Canonical internal schema and contract system.
- Unified policy engine (permissions, trust floor, budget constraints, contract compatibility).
- Unified audit + metering plane.
- Shared eval and replay infrastructure.

### Layer 1 responsibilities

- Publish/fork/version agents and pipelines.
- Surface behavioral diffs (trace + eval deltas).
- Provide trust signals, provenance, and compatibility metadata.

### Layer 2 responsibilities

- Runtime capability search via policy-first filtering.
- Dynamic delegation and lease-first capability acquisition.
- Cost guardrails + re-authorization + hard stops.
- Agent-to-agent execution contracts with SLA-aware retries.

### Non-negotiable design rule

- Never fork business logic by protocol. Keep canonical core; use protocol adapters (MCP, A2A, others) only at boundaries.

## 4) What The Market Is Proving (Hard Signals)

### Macro demand and interoperability pressure

- Salesforce (2026 Connectivity Report): 83% of orgs report broad AI-agent adoption, average of 12 agents today, +67% projected growth, 50% of agents still siloed, and 96% of IT leaders say success depends on cross-system integration.
- Gartner (2026 MAS guidance): predicts by 2027, 70% of multi-agent systems will use narrowly specialized agents (more delegation, more coordination complexity).
- Google A2A launch: 50+ partners at launch; Linux Foundation announcement later cites support from 100+ companies.

### Customer outcomes competitors are selling

- OpenAI: reports 1M+ business customers; 75% of surveyed customers say AI enabled tasks they previously could not do.
- Anthropic (customer examples):
  - ServiceNow reports up to 95% reduction in seller prep time, with a target 50% reduction in implementation time.
  - Headstart reports 10-100x faster development and 90-97% of client code generated by Claude.
- LangChain/LangSmith customer stories:
  - Formula 1 reports 95.95% issue detection in perfect scenarios and 71.44% in edge-case scenarios after adopting LangSmith.
- n8n customer story (Vodafone): 5,000 person-days saved, ~GBP 2.2M avoided costs, ~GBP 300k/month ongoing savings.
- Zapier customer stories:
  - Remote reports $500k hiring costs avoided, 27.5% of IT tickets auto-resolved, 11M automated tasks in 2024.
- Workato customer stories:
  - Broadcom reports ~6,500 human hours saved monthly.
  - Box reports partner onboarding process reduction by ~80%.

### Review-market sentiment (what users consistently praise)

- n8n (G2): 4.8/5 (209 reviews) with strong praise for flexibility and self-host control.
- Zapier (G2): 4.5/5 (~1,785 reviews) praised for ease of use and breadth of integrations; common complaint is price at scale.
- Workato (G2): 4.7/5 (745 reviews) praised for enterprise-grade automation + connectors; complaints include complexity and cost.

## 5) What Customers Love (And What To Steal)

### Love signals to copy directly

- Fast time-to-value and low setup friction.
- High connector breadth and compatibility.
- Strong observability/debugging for agent/tool failures.
- Clear business-outcome metrics (hours saved, escalations reduced, faster resolution).
- Governance and trust controls that make enterprise security teams comfortable.

### Pain signals to exploit

- Costs become unpredictable at scale.
- Debugging and root-cause analysis degrade with complex workflows.
- Governance and versioning often lag behind speed of automation growth.
- Multi-agent interoperability remains weak and fragmented.

### Product gap AgentHub can own

- Policy-first inter-agent exchange with deterministic guardrails.
- Unified trust + provenance + auditable cost controls across heterogeneous agents.
- Behavior-versioned agent registry where diffs include eval impact, not just prompt/config changes.

## 6) Continuation Roadmap (Session-Segmented)

All continuation sessions must follow `AGENTS.md` segment workflow:

1. Create session packet `docs/session-packets/Sxx.md`
2. Implement scoped changes only
3. Run required tests
4. Write evidence `docs/evidence/Sxx.md`
5. Update `/Users/demarioasquitt/Desktop/Projects/Entrepreneurial/agent-hub/docs/DELIVERABLE_LOG.md`
6. Update `/Users/demarioasquitt/Desktop/Projects/Entrepreneurial/agent-hub/docs/agenthub-master-plan-v1.2.docx`

### Segment map extension (post-S16)

| Segment | Deliverable Theme | Core Goal |
|---|---|---|
| S17 | Runtime Policy Engine v2 | Unify policy checks for search/delegation/install with explainable decisions |
| S18 | Capability Search v2 | Add policy-first filtering + semantic ranking explainability + benchmark harness |

| S22 | Federated Execution Gateway | Centralized discovery + federated execution adapters for enterprise boundaries |
| S23 | Registry UX/API Productization | Human-facing publish/fork/version workflow with behavior diff view |
| S24 | Lease-to-Install Promotion Flow | Safe persistent install path with approvals, rollback, and compatibility checks |
| S25 | Marketplace Alpha | Controlled paid capability exchange with policy-scoped procurement |
| S26 | Design-Partner Pilot A | End-to-end pilot with ROI instrumentation and incident log |
| S27 | Design-Partner Pilot B | Second vertical pilot + reliability, cost, and governance comparison |
| S28 | Gate Review v2 + GA Decision | Go/no-go for broader launch based on hard reliability + economics criteria |

## 8) KPI Framework (Required for Go/No-Go)

### Reliability and safety

- Delegation success rate (target >= 99.0% in pilot-critical flows).
- Idempotent-write safety incidents (target = 0 unresolved critical incidents).
- Policy bypass incidents (target = 0).

### Cost and economics

- Cost per completed delegated task (trend down over rolling 4-week window).
- Budget overrun rate past hard stop (target = 0).
- Gross margin per transaction after model/tool costs (tracked weekly).

### Adoption and value

- Time-to-first-successful-capability-delegation for new teams.
- % tasks completed without human escalation in scoped workflows.
- Measured customer outcome deltas (hours saved, cycle-time reduction, defect reduction).

## 9) Risks and Mitigations (High-Value)

- Risk: capability poisoning and trust gaming.
  - Mitigation: stronger provenance weighting, anti-sybil scoring, mandatory behavioral eval checks.
- Risk: runaway cost via recursive delegation.
  - Mitigation: hard depth limits, budget thresholds, mandatory re-authorization at 100%.
- Risk: interoperability drift across standards.
  - Mitigation: canonical schema with contract tests for every adapter release.
- Risk: enterprise data boundary concerns.
  - Mitigation: federated execution + central policy and trust; scoped, short-lived credentials.
